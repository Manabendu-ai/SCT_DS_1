# SCT DS Task 1 - Demographic Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates comprehensive demographic analysis using Python to visualize and analyze population distributions. Built as part of the **SkillCraft Technology Internship Program**, this analysis transforms raw demographic data into actionable insights through statistical analysis and professional visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create visualizations for categorical and continuous demographic variables
- Analyze population distribution by age groups and gender
- Calculate key demographic indicators like dependency ratios
- Generate professional-quality charts for data storytelling
- Provide statistical summaries for policy and business decision-making

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** - Core programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - Static visualizations
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment

## 📈 Key Features

### Visualization Types
1. **Age Distribution Histogram** - Continuous age data representation
2. **Age Groups Bar Chart** - Categorical breakdown with population counts
3. **Age Groups Pie Chart** - Percentage distribution visualization
4. **Gender Bar Chart** - Male vs Female population comparison
5. **Gender Pie Chart** - Gender distribution percentages
6. **Demographic Summary Panel** - Key statistics and insights

### Statistical Analysis
- **Dependency Ratios**: Youth (52.9%), Elderly (47.1%), Total (100.0%)
- **Age Statistics**: Median age (33.0 years), Mean age (36.6 years)
- **Population Breakdown**: 1,000,000 total population analyzed
- **Gender Distribution**: 48.5% Male, 51.5% Female

## 📊 Key Insights Discovered

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Youth Population (0-29)** | 44.4% | Large potential workforce/market |
| **Working Age (30-59)** | 37.8% | Current economic contributors |
| **Elderly (60+)** | 17.8% | Healthcare and pension planning needs |
| **Gender Balance** | 51.5% F / 48.5% M | Balanced demographic structure |
| **Dependency Ratio** | 100% | Equal dependents to working population |
